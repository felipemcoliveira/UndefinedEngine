# UndefinedEngine

The development of this project serves as a way to enhance my knowledge in game development. Much of the structure and patterns of the project are inspired by the Unreal Engine from Epic Games, such as coding standards, the idea of a "BuildTool," "HeaderTool," the HAL, and the folder structure.
